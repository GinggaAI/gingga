## üêõ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Test Variable Naming Consistency Issue**

**Problem:** After refactoring PlanningsController, tests were failing because they expected `assigns(:current_plan)` but the controller now uses `@current_strategy`.

**Error:**
```
Failure/Error: expect(assigns(:current_plan)).to eq(strategy_plan)
expected: #<CreasStrategyPlan id: "19ba23c2-e02f-4f3d-a0cd-91096683fdac"...>
     got: nil
```

**Root Cause:** Controller refactoring changed instance variable names but tests weren't updated accordingly.

**Solution:**
```ruby
# Before (failing)
expect(assigns(:current_plan)).to eq(strategy_plan)
expect(assigns(:current_plan)).to be_nil

# After (fixed)
expect(assigns(:current_strategy)).to eq(strategy_plan)  
expect(assigns(:current_strategy)).to be_nil
```

**Files Fixed:**
- `spec/requests/plannings_spec.rb`
- `spec/controllers/plannings_controller_spec.rb` (updated before removal)

**Best Practice:** Always update test expectations when refactoring controller instance variables.

---

### 2. **HAML Syntax Error - Duplicated Parameters**

**Problem:** Controller spec had invalid Ruby syntax with duplicated `params:` keys.

**Error:**
```
warning: key :params is duplicated and overwritten on line 67
```

**Root Cause:** Copy-paste error created invalid method call syntax.

**Solution:**
```ruby
# Before (invalid syntax)
get :show, params: {}, params: { plan_id: strategy_plan.id }

# After (correct syntax)  
get :show, params: { plan_id: strategy_plan.id }
```

**Files Fixed:**
- `spec/controllers/plannings_controller_refactored_spec.rb`

**Best Practice:** Always verify syntax when copying/modifying test code.

---

### 3. **Obsolete Test Files After Refactoring**

**Problem:** Old controller spec testing methods that no longer existed after refactoring, causing test failures.

**Error:**
```
NoMethodError: undefined method 'generate_weekly_plans_from_strategy' for #<PlanningsController>
```

**Root Cause:** When PlanningsController was refactored using service objects, old tests remained that tested private methods no longer in the controller.

**Solution:** 
- Removed obsolete test file: `spec/controllers/plannings_controller_spec.rb`
- Kept updated test file: `spec/controllers/plannings_controller_refactored_spec.rb`

**Best Practice:** Remove obsolete test files immediately after refactoring to avoid confusion and false failures.

---

### 4. **OpenAI API Model Updates (GPT-5 to GPT-4o)**

**Problem:** Code was attempting to use invalid "gpt-5" model which doesn't exist in OpenAI API.

**Root Cause:** Outdated model reference - GPT-5 is not available, GPT-4o is the correct current model.

**Solution:**
```ruby
# Before (invalid model)
def initialize(user:, model: "gpt-5", temperature: 0.4, timeout: 60)

# After (valid model)
def initialize(user:, model: "gpt-4o", temperature: 0.4, timeout: 60)
```

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/services/gingga_openai/chat_client.rb`

**Best Practice:** Always verify API model names against official documentation.

---

### 5. **Month Parameter Not Respected in Strategy Creation**

**Problem:** User-specified month parameter was being overridden by OpenAI response, causing strategies to be saved with incorrect dates.

**Root Cause:** Service was using the month from OpenAI response instead of the user's input parameter.

**Solution:**
```ruby
# Before (used OpenAI response month)
month: strategy_data['month']

# After (respects user parameter)
month: @month
```

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/services/creas/noctua_strategy_service.rb`
- `app/services/noctua_brief_assembler.rb`

**Best Practice:** Always respect user input parameters over AI-generated data.

---

### 6. **Frequency Per Week Not Respected**

**Problem:** OpenAI was generating ~5 content pieces regardless of user's `frequency_per_week` setting.

**Root Cause:** Prompts weren't explicit enough about frequency requirements.

**Solution:**
Enhanced prompts with explicit frequency rules:
```
‚Ä¢ Generate exactly frequency_per_week √ó 4 weeks of content ideas (e.g., 3/week = 12 total, 4/week = 16 total).
2 CRITICAL: total ideas across all 4 weeks MUST equal exactly frequency_per_week √ó 4.
```

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/services/creas/prompts.rb`

**Best Practice:** Be extremely explicit in AI prompts about numerical requirements and constraints.

---

### 7. **PlanningsController Refactoring for Rails Best Practices**

**Problem:** Original controller was 183 lines with multiple responsibilities, violating Single Responsibility Principle.

**Solution:** Refactored to 87 lines using service objects following Rails best practices:

**Service Objects Created:**
- `Planning::StrategyFinder` - Find strategies with month normalization
- `Planning::WeeklyPlansBuilder` - Build weekly plans from strategy data  
- `Planning::StrategyFormatter` - Format strategy data for API responses
- `Planning::MonthFormatter` - Format months for display

**Controller Improvements:**
- Single responsibility: coordinate between services and views
- Dependency injection for testability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper error handling
- Consistent API responses

**Best Practice:** Use service objects to extract complex business logic from controllers.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new features
- Tests written before implementation 
- Edge cases and error conditions covered
- Integration tests for full workflows

### 2. **Service Object Pattern**
- **Single Responsibility:** Each service has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Injection:** Services accept dependencies as parameters
- **Testability:** Easy to unit test in isolation
- **Reusability:** Services can be composed and reused

Example service implementation:
```ruby
module Planning
  class StrategyFinder
    def self.find_for_brand_and_month(brand, month)
      new(brand, month).find
    end

    def initialize(brand, month)
      @brand = brand
      @month = month
    end

    def find
      return nil unless @brand&.persisted?
      find_exact_match || find_normalized_match
    end

    private
    # ... implementation details
  end
end
```

### 3. **Presenter Pattern for View Logic**
- Encapsulate complex view logic in presenter classes
- Keep views clean and focused on presentation
- Easy to test business logic separate from templates
- Reusable across different views

### 4. **Rails 8 Compatibility**
- Updated deprecated status codes: `:unprocessable_entity` ‚Üí `:unprocessable_content`
- Modern enum syntax: `enum :platform, { ... }`
- Proper autoloading configuration
- Current testing patterns and best practices

### 5. **Error Handling Strategy**
- Specific exception classes for different error types
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation for external service failures

- Proper indexing on foreign keys
- Query optimization in service objects

### 2. **Security Best Practices**
