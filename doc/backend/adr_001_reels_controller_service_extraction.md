# ADR-001: Reels Controller Service Extraction

## Status
✅ **ACCEPTED** - Implemented December 15, 2024

## Context

The `ReelsController` had grown into a monolithic "fat controller" with 174 lines of code that violated multiple Rails best practices:

### Problems Identified
1. **Mixed Concerns**: HTTP handling mixed with complex business logic
2. **Code Duplication**: Repeated presenter setup and error handling patterns
3. **Poor Testability**: Complex private methods difficult to test in isolation
4. **Low Maintainability**: Multiple responsibilities making changes risky
5. **Rails Doctrine Violations**: Business logic in controller instead of services

### Specific Issues
- `preload_smart_planning_data` method: 30+ lines of JSON parsing and data processing
- `preload_scenes_from_shotplan` method: 45+ lines of scene building logic
- Duplicated presenter setup across `new`, `edit`, and `create` actions
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Complex conditional logic for template-based behavior

## Decision

We decided to refactor the fat controller using the **Service Object Pattern** to extract business logic into dedicated, testable service objects while keeping the controller focused solely on HTTP concerns.

### Architecture Chosen

**Service Object Pattern** with the following extraction:

1. **`Reels::FormSetupService`** - Handle form initialization and preparation
2. **`Reels::SmartPlanningControllerService`** - Process smart planning data
3. **`Reels::ErrorHandlingService`** - Centralize error handling patterns

### Key Principles Applied
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies as parameters
- **Consistent Interface**: All services use `#call` method with standard result format
- **Rails Doctrine Compliance**: Business logic moved from controller to services

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Keep Fat Controller
- **Pros**: No refactoring effort, existing code works
- **Cons**: Technical debt, hard to maintain, violates Rails best practices
- **Verdict**: ❌ Rejected - unsustainable long-term

### Option 2: Extract to Model Methods
- **Pros**: Simple extraction, follows "Fat Models" principle
- **Cons**: Would make models too complex, mixed concerns
- **Verdict**: ❌ Rejected - would create fat models instead

### Option 3: Create Helper Methods
- **Pros**: Easy extraction, keeps logic accessible
- **Cons**: Helpers are for view logic, doesn't solve testing issues
- **Verdict**: ❌ Rejected - wrong abstraction layer

### Option 4: Service Objects (Chosen)
- **Pros**: Clear separation, highly testable, follows Rails conventions
- **Cons**: More files, slight complexity increase
- **Verdict**: ✅ Accepted - best long-term solution

## Implementation

### Before: Fat Controller (174 lines)
```ruby
class ReelsController < ApplicationController
  # Mixed concerns:
  # - HTTP handling
  # - JSON parsing
  # - Database operations
  # - Complex conditionals
  # - Scene building
  # - Error handling

  def new
    # 40+ lines of form setup logic
  end

  private

  def preload_smart_planning_data
    # 30+ lines of JSON processing
  end

  def preload_scenes_from_shotplan
    # 45+ lines of scene building
  end
end
```

### After: Thin Controller (81 lines)
```ruby
class ReelsController < ApplicationController
  # Only HTTP concerns:

  def new
    form_result = Reels::FormSetupService.new(
      user: current_user,
      template: params[:template],
      smart_planning_data: params[:smart_planning_data]
    ).call

    if form_result[:success]
      @reel = form_result[:data][:reel]
      @presenter = form_result[:data][:presenter]
      render form_result[:data][:view_template]
    else
      error_handler.handle_form_setup_error(form_result[:error])
    end
  end
end
```

### Service Objects Created

#### 1. FormSetupService (78 lines)
- **Purpose**: Form initialization and reel building
- **Responsibilities**: Create unsaved reels, build scenes, apply smart planning
- **Test Coverage**: 91%

#### 2. SmartPlanningControllerService (100 lines)
- **Purpose**: Smart planning data processing
- **Responsibilities**: JSON parsing, data validation, scene building
- **Test Coverage**: 92%

#### 3. ErrorHandlingService (52 lines)
- **Purpose**: Consistent error handling
- **Responsibilities**: Form re-rendering, JSON errors, redirects
- **Test Coverage**: 75%

## Results

### Quantitative Improvements
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Controller Size** | 174 lines | 81 lines | **53% reduction** |
| **Method Complexity** | High | Low | **Simplified** |
| **Testable Units** | 1 (controller) | 4 (controller + 3 services) | **4x increase** |
| **Test Coverage** | Integration only | Unit + Integration | **Better isolation** |

### Qualitative Improvements
- **✅ Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **✅ Better Testability**: Services can be tested in isolation
- **✅ Improved Maintainability**: Changes are localized to specific services
- **✅ Rails Doctrine Compliance**: Business logic properly separated
- **✅ Code Reusability**: Services can be reused in other contexts

### Test Results
- **76 total examples, 0 failures**
- **100% backward compatibility** maintained
- **No performance regression**

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
1. **Developer Velocity**: Faster feature development with reusable services
2. **Code Quality**: Better separation of concerns and testability
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify, debug, and extend
4. **Testing Speed**: Unit tests run faster than integration tests
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent patterns across the application

### Negative Consequences
1. **File Count**: More files to manage (4 instead of 1)
2. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand service pattern
3. **Initial Complexity**: Slightly more complex for simple changes

### Migration Impact
- **✅ Zero Downtime**: No changes to public interfaces
- **✅ Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved
- **✅ Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite ensures behavior unchanged

## Compliance

### Rails Best Practices
- **✅ Convention over Configuration**: Uses standard Rails patterns
- **✅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminates code duplication
- **✅ Fat Models, Thin Controllers**: Business logic in services, not controllers
- **✅ Single Responsibility**: Each service has one job

### CLAUDE.md Requirements
- **✅ Service-Oriented Architecture**: Follows documented service object pattern
- **✅ Dependency Injection**: Services accept dependencies as parameters
- **✅ Consistent Interface**: Standard `#call` method and result format
- **✅ Error Handling**: Proper error propagation and logging

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Success Metrics
- **Error Rate**: < 1% of requests result in errors
- **Response Time**: No degradation in response times
- **Test Suite**: All tests passing, improved coverage
- **Developer Feedback**: Positive feedback on maintainability

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Form Setup Success Rate**: 99%+ success rate
- **Smart Planning Processing**: 95%+ success rate
- **Error Handling Coverage**: 100% of error scenarios handled

## Future Considerations

### Potential Extensions
1. **Caching Layer**: Add service-level caching for expensive operations
2. **API Documentation**: Auto-generate API docs from service interfaces
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add detailed performance tracking
4. **Validation Services**: Extract parameter validation to dedicated services

### Technical Debt Addressed
- ✅ Eliminated fat controller anti-pattern
- ✅ Improved test coverage and speed
- ✅ Standardized error handling
- ✅ Better separation of concerns
