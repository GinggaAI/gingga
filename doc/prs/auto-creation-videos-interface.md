# Auto Creation Videos Interface - Template-Based Reel System

**Date**: September 2, 2025  
**PR**: Auto Creation Videos Interface Refactoring  
**Author**: Claude  
**Branch**: vla/feature/voxa-show-info  

## Overview

Complete refactoring of the reel creation system from a simple `mode`-based approach to a comprehensive template-based architecture. This change enables different video creation workflows while following Rails conventions and maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## What Was Developed

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**Migration**: `20250902040043_RenameReelModeToTemplate`
- Renamed `reels.mode` column to `reels.template`
- No data migration needed as no existing reels in database

**Template Values**:
- `solo_avatars` - Single AI avatar speaking scenes
- `avatar_and_video` - Mix of AI avatars and video content
- `narration_over_7_images` - Voice narration over image sequence
- `one_to_three_videos` - Video compilation template

### 2. Model Architecture Refactoring

**File**: `app/models/reel.rb`

```ruby
# Key changes:
validates :template, presence: true, inclusion: { 
  in: %w[solo_avatars avatar_and_video narration_over_7_images one_to_three_videos],
  message: "%{value} is not a valid template"
}

validate :must_have_exactly_three_scenes, if: -> { template.in?(%w[solo_avatars avatar_and_video]) }
validate :all_scenes_must_be_complete, if: -> { requires_scenes? }

def ready_for_generation?
  case template
  when "solo_avatars", "avatar_and_video"
    reel_scenes.count == 3 && reel_scenes.all?(&:complete?)
  when "narration_over_7_images", "one_to_three_videos" 
    true # Future implementation
  else
    false
  end
end

def requires_scenes?
  template.in?(%w[solo_avatars avatar_and_video])
end
```

### 3. Service-Oriented Architecture

**Main Service**: `app/services/reel_creation_service.rb`
- Orchestrates reel creation process
- Delegates to template-specific services
- Maintains consistent interface

**Base Service**: `app/services/reels/base_creation_service.rb`
- Common functionality for all template services
- Handles reel initialization and parameter validation

**Template-Specific Services**:
- `app/services/reels/solo_avatars_creation_service.rb`
- `app/services/reels/avatar_and_video_creation_service.rb`
- `app/services/reels/narration_over_7_images_creation_service.rb`
- `app/services/reels/one_to_three_videos_creation_service.rb`

### 4. Presenter Pattern Implementation

**File**: `app/presenters/reel_scene_based_presenter.rb`
- Handles all view logic for scene-based templates
- Provides i18n keys and formatting
- Removes conditionals from views

**File**: `app/presenters/reel_narrative_presenter.rb`
- Handles view logic for narrative template
- Manages form data and validation messages

### 5. Controller Refactoring

**File**: `app/controllers/reels_controller.rb`

```ruby
# Thin controller following Rails doctrine
def new
  template = params[:template]
  return redirect_to reels_path, alert: "Invalid template" unless valid_template?(template)
  
  result = ReelCreationService.new(user: current_user, template: template).initialize_reel
  
  if result[:success]
    @reel = result[:reel]
    setup_presenter(template)
    render template_view(template)
  else
    redirect_to reels_path, alert: result[:error]
  end
end

def create
  result = ReelCreationService.new(user: current_user, params: reel_params).call
  
  if result[:success]
    redirect_to result[:reel], notice: "Reel created successfully! Your reel is being generated."
  else
    @reel = result[:reel]
    setup_presenter(@reel.template)
    render template_view(@reel.template), status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end
```

### 6. RESTful Routing

**File**: `config/routes.rb`

```ruby
resources :reels, only: [ :index, :new, :create, :show ] do
  collection do
    get "scene-based", to: "reels#new", defaults: { template: "solo_avatars" }, as: :scene_based
    get "narrative", to: "reels#new", defaults: { template: "narration_over_7_images" }, as: :narrative
    post "scene-based", to: "reels#create", defaults: { template: "solo_avatars" }
    post "narrative", to: "reels#create", defaults: { template: "narration_over_7_images" }
    get "new/:template", to: "reels#new", as: :new_template
  end
end
```

**Generated Routes**:
- `/en/reels/scene-based` (GET/POST) - Scene-based reel creation
- `/en/reels/narrative` (GET/POST) - Narrative reel creation
- `/en/reels/new/:template` - Generic template creation

### 7. View Layer Modernization

**Templates**: Converted from ERB to HAML
- `app/views/reels/scene_based.html.haml`
- `app/views/reels/narrative.html.haml`

**Key Features**:
- No logic in views (extracted to presenters)
- Full i18n support
- Clean HAML syntax
- Proper form handling with Rails helpers

### 8. Internationalization

**Files**: 
- `config/locales/en.yml`
- `config/locales/es.yml`

**Added Translations**:
```yaml
reels:
  create_reel: "Create Reel"
  description: "Choose your preferred creation method and generate engaging video content"
  tabs:
    scene_based: "Scene-Based"
    narrative: "Narrative"
  fields:
    title: "Reel Title"
    description: "Description"
  # ... extensive translation coverage
```

### 9. Testing Infrastructure

**Updated Files**:
- `spec/models/reel_spec.rb` - Complete test coverage for new template system
- `spec/factories/reels.rb` - Factory updated with template traits

**Test Coverage**: 17 test cases passing, covering:
- Template validation
- Scene requirements per template
- Business logic methods
- Factory integrity

## Problems That Appeared

### 1. Template Field Recognition Issue

**Problem**: After database migration, ActiveRecord didn't recognize the new `template` attribute
**Error**: `NoMethodError: undefined method 'template=' for an instance of Reel`

**Root Cause**: Migration only ran in development environment, not in test environment

**Solution**: 
```bash
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:migrate
```

### 2. Test Validation Message Mismatch

**Problem**: Shoulda matcher expected standard Rails validation message but got custom message
**Error**: Expected "is not included in the list" but got "invalid_template is not a valid template"

**Solution**: Replaced generic shoulda matcher with specific test case:
```ruby
it 'validates template inclusion with custom message' do
  reel = build(:reel, user: user, template: 'invalid_template')
  expect(reel).to be_invalid
  expect(reel.errors[:template]).to include('invalid_template is not a valid template')
end
```

### 3. Route Naming Conflicts

**Problem**: Initial implementation had conflicting route names and overly complex routing

**Solution**: Simplified to clean RESTful routes with defaults parameter and proper naming

### 4. View Logic Complexity

**Problem**: Original ERB views contained conditional logic violating Rails doctrine

**Solution**: Extracted all logic to presenter classes, making views purely presentational

## How Problems Were Resolved

### 1. Environment Consistency
- Ensured migrations run in all environments (development, test)
- Used proper Rails environment management commands
- Verified database schema changes with `bin/rails routes` and test runs

### 2. Test Strategy Refinement
- Moved from generic shoulda matchers to specific test cases where custom behavior exists
- Updated factory traits to match new template system
- Comprehensive test coverage for all template types

### 3. Rails Doctrine Compliance
- Implemented thin controllers using service objects
- Created presenter pattern for view logic
- Followed POST-REDIRECT-GET pattern consistently
- Used proper Rails conventions for routing and naming

### 4. Progressive Implementation
- Incremental changes with continuous testing
- Maintained backwards compatibility during transition
- Complete removal of legacy code after verification

## What Should Be Avoided in Future

### 1. Environment Migration Gaps
**Issue**: Running migrations only in one environment
**Prevention**: Always run migrations in all environments when testing
```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:migrate
```

### 2. Generic Test Matchers for Custom Logic
**Issue**: Using shoulda matchers for custom validation messages
**Prevention**: Write specific test cases for custom business logic, use shoulda matchers for standard Rails validations

### 3. Logic in Views
**Issue**: Putting conditional logic directly in view templates
**Prevention**: Always use presenter pattern for view logic, keep views purely presentational

### 4. Route Complexity
**Issue**: Creating overly complex routing with multiple parameters
**Prevention**: Use RESTful conventions with defaults parameter for clean, semantic URLs

### 5. Incomplete Refactoring
**Issue**: Leaving legacy code alongside new implementation
**Prevention**: Complete refactoring process, remove all legacy code after verification

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Scalability
- Easy to add new template types
- Service objects handle template-specific logic
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. Maintainability
- Rails conventions followed throughout
- Clear presenter pattern for view logic
- Comprehensive i18n support

### 3. Testability
- Each service object independently testable
- Template-specific behavior isolated
- Factory traits for different scenarios

### 4. User Experience
- Clean, semantic URLs
- Proper form handling with validation
- Multi-language support

## Future Considerations

### 1. Template Expansion
- Additional fields needed for `one_to_three_videos` template
- Video upload/URL handling for compilation templates
- AI avatar selection interface improvements

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Eager loading for template-specific associations
- Caching strategies for presenter data
- Background job processing for reel generation

### 3. Error Handling Enhancement
- Template-specific error messages
- Better user guidance for incomplete forms
- Progress indicators for generation process
