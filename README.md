## 🏗️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.4.2+
- Rails 8.0+
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js and npm
- Docker (for development services)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@github.com:vlaguzman/gingga.git
cd gingga/

# Install dependencies
bundle install
npm install

# Setup database
docker-compose up -d        # Start PostgreSQL and Selenium
bundle exec rails db:setup  # Create and migrate database

# Verify installation
bundle exec rspec           # Run test suite
npm run build:css          # Build CSS

# Start development server
bin/dev                    # Runs Rails server + CSS watcher
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## 🧪 Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. Read [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) contributor guide
2. Review relevant documentation in `/doc`
3. Run existing tests to ensure clean slate

### Development Process
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Write tests first (TDD approach)
# Implement feature
# Ensure tests pass with 90%+ coverage

# Run quality checks before committing
bundle exec rspec              # All tests must pass
bundle exec rubocop           # Code style compliance
bundle exec brakeman          # Security scan
npm run build:css             # Rebuild CSS assets

# Alternative: Run all checks together
bash bin/shot                 # Comprehensive verification script
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run full test suite
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test files
bundle exec rspec spec/models/
bundle exec rspec spec/services/some_service_spec.rb

# Check test coverage
open coverage/index.html
```
