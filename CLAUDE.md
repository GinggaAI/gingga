# CLAUDE.md - Gingga Rails Application Contributor Guide

## üìã Getting Started

**READ THIS FIRST**: This document is the main contributor guide for the Gingga Rails application. Before writing any code, read this document completely and review the relevant documentation in the `/doc` folder.

---

## üìÅ Documentation Structure

All documentation is organized in `/doc` with the following structure:

- **`/doc/backend/`** - Backend architecture, API, database, models, services, and integrations
- **`/doc/frontend/`** - Frontend UI structure, components, JavaScript logic, and styling
- **`/doc/manual_test/`** - Manual testing guides for QA and user-facing testing

**IMPORTANT**: Always check the relevant `/doc` subdirectory for context before starting work on any feature or bug fix.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Development Standards

We follow strict development standards to ensure high-quality, maintainable code:

### Core Principles
- **Ruby on Rails conventions** - Follow Rails best practices and idioms
- **Rails Doctrine** - Follow the Rails way: Convention over Configuration, DRY, Fat Models/Thin Controllers
- **POST-REDIRECT-GET Pattern** - **IMPORTANT**: Always implement POST-REDIRECT-GET pattern for forms to prevent duplicate submissions and improve user experience
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Write tests first, then implement
- **90%+ test coverage** - All new files must achieve at least 90% test coverage
- **Service-oriented architecture** - Extract business logic into service objects
- **Security-first mindset** - Always consider security implications

### Rails Doctrine and Patterns

#### POST-REDIRECT-GET Pattern (PRG)
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All form submissions MUST follow the POST-REDIRECT-GET pattern:

```ruby
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - POST-REDIRECT-GET Pattern
def create
  @resource = Resource.new(resource_params)
  
  if @resource.save
    redirect_to @resource, notice: 'Resource was successfully created.'
  else
    render :new, status: :unprocessable_content
  end
end

# ‚ùå INCORRECT - Direct template rendering without redirect
def create
  @resource = Resource.new(resource_params)
  @resource.save
  render :show  # This violates PRG pattern
end
```

**Why PRG is Essential:**
- Prevents duplicate form submissions on browser refresh
- Improves user experience and data integrity
- Follows Rails conventions and web standards
- Enables proper browser history navigation

#### Rails Doctrine Adherence
Follow these fundamental Rails principles:

1. **Convention over Configuration**
   - Use Rails naming conventions for models, controllers, views
   - Follow RESTful routing patterns
   - Use standard Rails directory structure

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Extract common code into helpers, concerns, or services
   - Use partials for repeated view logic
   - Leverage Rails generators and conventions

3. **Fat Models, Thin Controllers**
   - Business logic belongs in models or service objects
   - Controllers should orchestrate, not implement business rules
   - Keep controller actions focused on HTTP concerns

4. **Presenter Pattern for View Logic**
   - **FORBIDDEN**: No `if` statements in views - this indicates need for a presenter
   - Extract all conditional logic from views into presenter objects
   - Views should only contain display logic and simple iteration
   - Use presenters to encapsulate complex view logic and formatting

### Required Quality Gates
- ‚úÖ All tests must pass (`bundle exec rspec`)
- ‚úÖ 90%+ code coverage on new/modified files
- ‚úÖ No RuboCop violations
- ‚úÖ No security issues (Brakeman scan)
- ‚úÖ All deprecation warnings resolved
- ‚úÖ POST-REDIRECT-GET pattern implemented for all forms
- ‚úÖ Rails Doctrine principles followed

---

## üß™ Testing Standards

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **New files**: Minimum 90% line coverage
- **Modified files**: Maintain or improve existing coverage
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage for authentication, payments, data integrity

### Testing Structure
```
spec/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/              # Model validations, associations, business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/            # Service object functionality and edge cases
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/         # HTTP responses, authentication, authorization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/         # Full workflow testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system/              # End-to-end browser testing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ factories/           # Test data creation
```

### Testing Best Practices
- **Test-first approach**: Write failing tests before implementation
- **Descriptive test names**: Clearly describe what is being tested
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests for clarity
- **Mock external dependencies**: Use stubs/mocks for API calls, file systems
- **Test edge cases**: Handle nil values, empty arrays, validation failures

### Example Test Structure
```ruby
RSpec.describe SomeService do
  describe '#call' do
    context 'when valid parameters are provided' do
      it 'creates the expected result' do
        # Arrange
        user = create(:user)
        params = { name: 'Test' }
        
        # Act
        result = described_class.new(user: user, params: params).call
        
        # Assert  
        expect(result.success?).to be true
        expect(result.data[:name]).to eq('Test')
      end
    end
    
    context 'when invalid parameters are provided' do
      it 'returns an error result' do
        # Test error conditions
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## üîß Service Object Pattern

Extract complex business logic into service objects following this pattern:

### Service Object Structure
```ruby
# app/services/domain/action_service.rb
module Domain
  class ActionService
    def initialize(user:, **options)
      @user = user
      @options = options
    end

    def call
      return failure_result('User required') unless @user
      
      # Business logic here
      
      success_result(data: processed_data)
    rescue StandardError => e
      failure_result("Error: #{e.message}")
    end

    private

    def processed_data
      # Implementation details
    end

    def success_result(data:)
      OpenStruct.new(success?: true, data: data, error: nil)
    end

    def failure_result(error_message)
      OpenStruct.new(success?: false, data: nil, error: error_message)
    end
  end
end
```

### Service Object Guidelines
- **Single responsibility**: Each service does one thing well
- **Dependency injection**: Accept dependencies as parameters
- **Consistent interface**: Use `#call` method as entry point
- **Error handling**: Always handle and communicate errors clearly
- **Return objects**: Use consistent result objects for success/failure

---

## üé® Frontend Standards

### CSS Architecture
- **Design tokens**: Use CSS variables defined in `app/assets/stylesheets/tokens.css`
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-based styling
- **Component-specific CSS**: Co-located with ViewComponents when needed
- **Build process**: `npm run build:css` compiles to `app/assets/builds/application.css`

### ViewComponent Guidelines  
```ruby
# app/components/ui/button_component.rb
class UI::ButtonComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  def initialize(variant: :primary, size: :medium, **options)
    @variant = variant
    @size = size
    @options = options
  end

  private

  attr_reader :variant, :size, :options
end
```

### JavaScript (Stimulus Controllers)
```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/example_controller.js
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = ["output"]
  static values = { count: Number }

  connect() {
    // Initialization logic
  }

  increment() {
    this.countValue++
    this.outputTarget.textContent = this.countValue
  }
}
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Always Consider
- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **SQL injection prevention**: Use parameterized queries
- **XSS protection**: Sanitize output in views
- **Authentication**: Verify user permissions
- **API security**: Validate API tokens and rate limiting
- **Secrets management**: Never commit secrets to repository

### Security Checklist
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] API endpoints properly authenticated
- [ ] No secrets in code or logs
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
